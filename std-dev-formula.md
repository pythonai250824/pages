## Standard Deviation Formula

The standard deviation (σ) is calculated as:

$$\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2}$$

Where:
- N is the number of samples
- x_i is each individual value
- μ is the mean of the values

For sample standard deviation (rather than population), we use:

$$s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}$$

Where:
- N is the number of samples
- x_i is each individual value
- x̄ is the sample mean
