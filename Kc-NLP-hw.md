# ðŸ’ª NLP Exercises with SpaCy

## ðŸ“Œ Instructions

### 1. Named Entities Extraction
**Task:**  
Given the sentence:
```python
"Taylor Swift performed in Los Angeles on March 3rd, 2023."
```
Print all named entities along with their labels.

Expected output:
```text
Taylor Swift PERSON
Los Angeles GPE
March 3rd, 2023 DATE
```

### 2. Entity Classification
**Task:**  
Write a function that receives a sentence and prints only the entities of type `PERSON`.

Example input:
```python
"Serena Williams had dinner with Tom Hanks in Paris."
```

Expected output:
```text
Serena Williams
Tom Hanks
```

### 3. Lemmatization
**Task:**  
Given the sentence:
```python
"She was running and had run 5 kilometers by 7am."
```
Print each word with its **lemma**.

Expected output (example):
```text
She        â†’ she
was        â†’ be
running    â†’ run
...
```

### 4. Stop Word Removal
**Task:**  
Write a function that receives a sentence and returns a list of words that are **not stop words**.

Example input:
```python
"This is an example sentence with some stop words."
```
Expected output:
```python
['example', 'sentence', 'stop', 'words']
```

### 5. Custom Stop Word
**Task:**  
Mark the word `"powerful"` as a stop word, then check if SpaCy treats it as such. Use the sentence below to check its behavior:

Example input:
```python
"SpaCy is awesome and powerful."
```

In this sentence, the following words should be considered stop words:
- is (already stop word)
- and (already stop word)
- powerful (after we add it)

### 6. Phrase Matcher
**Task:**  
Use `PhraseMatcher` to identify the phrase `"artificial intelligence"` in a sentence and print matches.

Example input:
```python
"Artificial Intelligence is the future. I study artificial intelligence."
```
Expected output:
```text
Artificial Intelligence
artificial intelligence
```

### 7. POS Tagging + Explanation
**Task:**  
Write a function that prints each word in a sentence with its POS tag and a human-readable explanation.

Example input:
```python
"The cat sat on the mat."
```
Expected output:
```text
The        DET        determiner
cat        NOUN       noun
sat        VERB       verb
...
```

### 8. Accessing the Pipeline + Custom Sentence Separator

**Task:**  
Write a function that uses `^` as a **custom sentence separator** (instead of a period or semicolon). The function should split a given string into separate sentences wherever the `^` symbol appears.

Example input:
```python
"SpaCy is great^It helps with NLP tasks^Really useful."
```

Expected output:
```text
Sentence: SpaCy is great
Sentence: It helps with NLP tasks
Sentence: Really useful.
```

### 9. POS Tagging + Displacy Visualization
**Task:**  
Ask the user to input a sentence using `input()`, print each word with its POS tag, and then display it using `spacy.displacy.render`.

Example input:
```python
"Apple is looking at buying a U.K. startup for $1 billion."
```

Expected output:
```text
Apple      PROPN     proper noun
is         AUX       auxiliary
looking    VERB      verb
...
```
